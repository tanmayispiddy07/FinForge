# FinForge: Customer 360 Data Product for Retail Banking



FinForge is a secure, multi-agent AI-driven Streamlit application designed to create a Customer 360 data product for retail banking. It processes synthetic banking data to generate schemas, mappings, configurations, and actionable insights, leveraging Google Vertex AI for advanced analytics and a chatbot interface. The app includes AES encryption and SHA-256 hashing for security, making it suitable for demonstrating data product workflows in a banking context.

## Features
- **Multi-Agent Workflow**: Orchestrates agents for business requirements, schema design, source discovery, attribute mapping, transformations, certification, and insights generation.
- **Synthetic Data Processing**: Uses preloaded CSV files (`customers.csv`, `transactions.csv`, etc.) to simulate real-world banking data.
- **Vertex AI Integration**: Powers insights and chatbot functionality with Google’s Gemini model (configurable via environment variables).
- **Security**: Implements AES encryption for PII and SHA-256 hashing for data integrity.
- **Downloadable Outputs**: Generates `finforge_schema.json`, `finforge_mappings.csv`, and `finforge_config.yaml` for easy export.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly dashboard and chatbot experience.

## Demo
Check out the deployed app on Streamlit Cloud: [FinForge Demo](https://finforge.streamlit.app) *(Update with your actual URL after deployment)*.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9–3.12
- Git
- Google Cloud Project with Vertex AI enabled (optional for full functionality)
- Streamlit Cloud account for deployment

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanmayispiddy07/FinForge.git
   cd FinForge
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   See `requirements.txt` for the full list of packages, including `streamlit`, `pandas`, `langchain`, `transformers`, and `pycryptodome`.

## Synthetic Data Creation
FinForge uses synthetic data generated by `data.py`. It creates six CSV files (`customers.csv`, `transactions.csv`, `credit_data.csv`, `collateral.csv`, `deposits.csv`, `behavior.csv`) using `pandas`, `numpy`, and `faker`. The script simulates 100 customers with attributes like names, ages, and incomes, plus related transactions, credit details, collateral, deposits, and behavioral data. Random values are seeded for reproducibility (e.g., `np.random.seed(42)`). Run `python data.py` to generate these files locally.

## Usage

1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
   ```bash
   python data.py
   ```
   This populates the required CSV files in the root directory.

2. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run customer360_app.py
   ```
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` to access the dashboard.

3. **Configure Vertex AI (Optional)**:
   - Set the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable with your Google Cloud service account key:
     ```bash
     export GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON='{"type":"service_account",...}'
     ```
   - Alternatively, add it to Streamlit Cloud’s environment variables (see Deployment section).

4. **Interact with the App**:
   - Enter a use case (e.g., "Fraud Detection and Transaction Monitoring") in the sidebar.
   - Click "Generate Outputs" to see schema, mappings, config, and insights.
   - Use the chatbot to ask questions about the dashboard outputs.



## Security Considerations
- **Service Account Key**: Never commit `inspired-rock-450806-r5-d18f93b7f5ba.json` to the repo. Use environment variables or Streamlit secrets instead.
- **Encryption**: PII is encrypted with AES; the key is hardcoded as `Sixteen byte key` for demo purposes. In production, use a secure key management system (e.g., Google KMS).
- **Fallback Mode**: If Vertex AI credentials are missing, the app uses basic analytics, ensuring it remains functional in public demos.

## Example Output
Running "Fraud Detection and Transaction Monitoring":
- **Schema**: Defines fields like `customer_id`, `credit_score`, `transaction_amount`.
- **Mappings**: Maps source attributes to `customer_360` targets with confidence scores.
- **Config**: Specifies ingress (ETL), egress (API), and security settings.
- **Insights**: E.g., "- 12 out of 100 customers (12.0%) have high risk (credit_score < 600, balance > 50% loan)."
